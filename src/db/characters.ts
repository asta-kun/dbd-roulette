Here he would have his final revenge.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFreddy stalked the boy through the school\u0027s halls. He took his time, savoring every moment of the hunt.

To make them forget the worries of the world and just enjoy themselves, if only for a while.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith age came a new-found freedom. She bought a battered old Chevy truck and was able to travel around by herself, meeting fans and making new friends wherever she stopped.

She saw it as a way of giving back, of supporting others in the same way she had.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt was home where she found most of her inspiration as well. She had always loved to take long walks in the woods around her town, exploring off the beaten track, finding a quiet spot to play and write her songs. She had a favorite location she returned to time and again, a natural hollow, encircled by trees, that looked almost as if it had been blasted out of the rocks thousands of years ago.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHere she felt a strong connection to nature, and to the Earth itself. She let her mind be enveloped by the forest and it rewarded her with constant inspiration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EShe picked up her guitar and played, her fingers dancing across the fretboard. The music that she made this time was unlike her usual uplifting tunes, being much more melancholy, even dark. Still, something compelled her to continue, to finish the song.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAround her, the leaves vibrated in unison with the guitar strings and the boughs of the trees lengthened, coalescing into a living form. Spider-like legs descended from the canopy above, grasping for her.

When sunlight became too dim for productive activities, they would take refuge in their house, a sturdy old cabin constructed to resist the toughest winters. Close to the hearth\u2019s warmth, Anna would rest in her mother\u2019s arms, surrounded by the few wooden toys and masks she had crafted for her.

The elk was close enough for Anna to see the murderous fury in its eyes when her mother threw herself in its path, axe in hand. A bloodcurdling scream escaped from her lips as the elk impaled her upon its antlers and hoisted her into the air.

He met the impulsive Joey, who liked to show off, and the shy, naive Susie, who was Julie\u2019s best friend.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThey would hang out at an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Their time together was the perfect break from the boring conformity of their small, insignificant everyday lives. Frank saw it as an opportunity to shape their lack of experience into something powerful. He lined up nights of debauchery and rampage, testing their limits. Bullying, vandalism, and theft were essentially their weekend plans. It came to a point where they would do anything he asked. Nothing was off-limits when they put their masks on. One evening, Frank dared Joe to vandalize the store that had recently fired him. They snuck inside easily enough as the building was supposed to be empty after closing hours. But a cleaner who was still there grabbed Julie as soon as she came near. Hearing her stifled cries, a dark impulse took over Frank. He rushed to her aid knife in hand and, without hesitating, planted the blade into the cleaner\u2019s back.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs the group stared at Frank in shock, he ordered them to finish the job. Joe clenched his jaw, grabbed the knife, and stabbed the bleeding man in the ribs. Susie didn\u2019t want to do it. Frank shouted at her; they had to finish what they\u2019d started. Julie closed her eyes and jabbed the knife into the man\u2019s chest. She handed the wet blade to Susie: they were all in this together now. Susie stared at Julie in disbelief as Frank grabbed her trembling hands and inserted the knife deep into the man\u2019s throat. Frank told them to move fast: they mopped the blood off the floor, stashed the body in the trunk of Joe\u2019s car and drove up Mount Ormond.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAll four were digging in the muddy snow to dispose of the body when Frank spotted something moving through the woods. He grabbed his knife and broke from the group to check it out. The Fog thickened around Frank, becoming so dense that he soon could no longer see ahead. He retraced his steps and stumbled on an ominous trail. He followed the eerie path, as if called by the darkness.  Julie, Susie, and Joe finished digging but Frank was nowhere to be seen. Julie spotted his muddy footsteps in the snow and the three of them followed the trail, which took them deeper into the woods. When Julie, Susie, and Joe did not return home that night, their parents thought they\u2019d run away with Frank. Each family came up with a different theory. The mood of the town changed, however, when a body was found by an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond.","biography":"A band of merciless Killers, able to rushdown helpless Survivors with their power, \u003Cb\u003EFeral Frenzy\u003C/b\u003E.

From the reports, the victims seemed chosen at random, yet the killer knew his way around in the houses. The multiple stab wounds indicated a personal motive. No traces of DNA were found. The local police were confounded: the murders were carried with fury akin to a crime of passion yet coldly premeditated.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe murderer also liked to stalk his targets. Two victims had reported being followed on their way home by a dark figure, a few days prior their death. The killer would follow them from Walleyes, a small bar in Northern Roseville, and snap pictures of them at home, while looking for a way in. He could watch the same victim for weeks, meticulously registering their habits and routines. When he felt the urge to kill, he\u2019d visit the most vulnerable victim on his list, and break inside the house quietly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe whole staff worked on the Roseville Murders story.

The masked face, a white blur in the dark, stared at the camera for a second, before disappearing inside. \u201CGhost Face Caught on Tape\u201D was the resulting article, written by Olsen. He seemed proud of his work at the time, enjoying how the whole town feared his ghost stories.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWeeks later, Olsen left a note on his work desk and disappeared:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u201CI hope you liked my stories--I enjoyed bringing them to life.

A faint pang of hunger hit him, and he wondered when he had eaten last. Was it this morning, while washing his knife and clothes? Or was it last night, after following that girl down the street?

On the edge of the frontier, sickness, famine, and death were common sights, and pioneers contended for whatever scraps they could claim while tycoons feasted. Caleb\u0027s father, once an engineer, had few options to ply his trade as businesses\u00A0posted a common sign:\u00A0No Irish Need Apply.

Rage overwhelming him, he burst into Bayshore\u2019s office and smashed his face into a bloody stew.

A railroad spike plowed through skin and viscera, nailing Bayshore to his desk.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe only thing that saved Caleb from hanging was Bayshore\u0027s unlikely survival.

In a fortress of illiterate convicts, he found an unlikely friend in the educated prison warden. He designed torture devices for him and in return received extra meals. After a time, the warden offered to commute his sentence. He spoke of something greater than monetary wealth\u2014political capital\u2014and that his connections could have Bayshore framed and rotting behind bars for life. He had only one request: Make him rich. Fill the prison. Use ingenuity to bring outlaws in alive.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECaleb returned to his workshop, and with a few modifications emerged with something new\u2014the speargun. The first trial occurred when a thief robbed a Chinese laundry. Seizing on the opportunity, Caleb unleashed his prototype. Metal joints screeched as the spike shot forward, gouging into the target\u0027s abdomen. But as the spear tugged it caught the thief\u0027s intestines and, with an ungodly sound, yanked them onto the dusty road.\u00A0After several iterations the disembowelments dwindled, but Caleb had already earned his new nickname: The\u00A0Deathslinger.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELooking to protect his asset, the\u00A0prison warden pulled strings and released Irish inmates to form Caleb\u0027s posse.

Urgent reports of injustice captivated Zarina, inspiring her to produce her own stories. When she was a teenager, she embraced her real name and roots and borrowed her father\u2019s digital camera to interview members of her community in Bay Ridge. By posting her content online, she slowly built a loyal following. Each week, she picked a new issue and challenged people to speak their mind on camera.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen she heard a rumor that a fast-food restaurant owner was exploiting workers, she decided to go undercover and produce a hard-hitting film.

To retaliate, she posted clips of the restaurant owner\u2019s abusive behavior and within hours the news had picked up her story, but somehow spun it to create sympathy for the restaurant owner.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEmbittered by the experience, Zarina committed to become an independent producer and filmmaker. Her first feature film was for a competition at school inspired by an English class poem about Sacco and Vanzetti, two Italian migrants controversially executed for murder. Her film won first prize and launched her as an uncompromising documentary filmmaker.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMonths later, her world turned upside down. A public video surveillance camera filmed her father carrying two coffees at a street corner a few blocks from home. A tall, hooded man stood behind him.

Jeff accepted the challenge and painted a large mural depicting \u201CThe Legion\u201D in runny, bloody letters. He was given a fifty-dollar bill and a 12-pack for his hard work.

Evil possessed his friends, whom he was forced to kill, and his right hand, which he sawed off. For the next thirty years, Ash ran from his past, working at a Value Stop department store and seducing women in dive bars. But he screwed up one night while being high, when he read from the Necronomicon to impress a woman. Evil found him once more, wrecking the life of those around him. But his coworkers, Pablo who was raised by a shaman and Kelly who was orphaned by the Deadites, helped him put up a fight. While battling Evil, Ash was reunited with his long-lost daughter Brandy, who encouraged him to embrace his role as savior of humanity. After a terrible fight with a fully formed demon, Ash, drawing his last breath, was taken by the Knights of Sumeria and transported into the future.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAsh awakened to a voice, his head throbbing. Since defeating a gang of Deadites a week ago, he had been in a perpetual state of hangover. He heard the voice once more; a woman singing, sensual and inviting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EStepping into the corridor in his boxers, he strode toward the voice, which lead to the public locker room. As Ash pushed open the door, the singing stopped. There was a rustling of curtains. He called out, entering the change room. His voice reverberated on the moldy tiled walls. He pressed on, reaching a shower that was still dripping wet. Cold, humid fingers ran down his bare back. He turned around.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA woman stood naked, her skin glistening in the morning light that streamed in from high windows. Ash recognized her instantly: Linda Emery, one of his former high school flings. They had gotten back together thirty years later, while saving their hometown from Evil. He had ended their relationship soon afterward, preferring to indulge freely in his new-found popularity.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELinda winked at Ash, who closed the distance between them. He caressed her cheek wistfully: \u003Ci\u003EWhat was she doing here? Did she know anything about the whereabouts of her daughter? And Pablo and Kelly?\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA sharp blade dug into his hand, making him jump back. Linda slid a finger across the edge of her blade, collecting Ash\u2019s blood on her fingertip. She smiled, and her skin shriveled, her hair faded, her shoulders stooped, and her curves sagged, aging decades older in a matter of seconds. She attacked Ash, who poorly managed to block, being half-naked.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEvery blow she delivered earned him a new wound. She slashed his bad knee and he fell to the floor. As she jumped on top of him, Ash shrieked in disgust, knocking the knife out of her grasp. Her varicose hands wrapped around his neck, strangling him. Gasping, he outstretched his arm, hand landing on a soap dispenser. He spurted out some liquid on his fingers and poked her in the eyes. The elderly woman winced, weakening her hold, and Ash elbowed her in the face, knocking her back. He rolled over and grabbed the knife on the floor. Just as he was about to plant it in her chest, he stopped. There was something else he wanted more.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe pressed the blade against her throat. \u003Ci\u003ELet\u2019s make a deal, demon.

When nothing happened, Ash threatened the demon, who argued back, blaming his poor pronunciation. Their combined exchange of Sumerian words triggered a hiss from the showers behind them. The wet tiled floor darkened, and the pipes burst. A whirlpool of dirty water, shower curtains, and used toilet paper swallowed the demon, while Ash held onto a locker door, which slowly slipped from his fingers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ci\u003EFFFUUUC\u2014\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAsh landed flat on his chest in the realm of the Entity, sputtering grass.

This event drove a rift between him and his father that never closed. As the boy grew, so did his father\u2019s resentment, and his drinking habit. By the time Kenneth was at school, they lived mostly separate lives.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAcademically, he was unremarkable, coasting by on his significant athletic prowess. He grew tall and strong, excelling at track events, but shunned any attempts to coax him into team sports.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOn his walk home from school, he would often find feathers on the ground and he soon began a collection, keeping them in a cigar box under his bed. With his father either at work or in an alcohol-induced stupor, Kenneth had hours to spend alone, transfixed by the regularity of the feathers\u2019 barbs and feeling the softness as he ran them over his lips. Watching the birds that came to the feeder in his garden, he imagined how soft they must be and resolved to catch one. He ingratiated himself with the local dentist, soon procuring some anesthetic. Using this, he rigged up a trap on the feeder, that he hoped would knock out a bird long enough that he could touch it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter a few failed attempts, he managed to trap a robin. As it lay in his hand, he felt a sudden rush, of a life at his mercy. He had planned to release it once it recovered from the anesthetic. Instead, as its eyes flickered back into consciousness and it began to struggle, his grip remained firm. His fingers slowly tightened around its throat, squeezing until its chest feathers were finally still. He disposed of the body, keeping just a feather, with which he started a new collection, discarding the others as \u2018fake\u2019.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the late 1940s, Kenneth had left school and started working as a busboy at a local diner. He had also escalated to larger prey, like squirrels, raccoons and dogs, becoming skilled at customizing the anesthetic dosage for each.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn early 1954, a young man went missing and the town was turned upside down in the search. A few months later, Kenneth\u2019s father, while doing some work in the crawlspace under the house, found a cigar box. He broke it open and saw, to his horror, that it contained feathers, animal paws, and a man\u2019s finger.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EReturning from work, Kenneth saw his father leaving the crawlspace with a cigar box in his hands. He turned on his heel and never went home again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter a few weeks of living rough, he encountered a traveling circus and, with his prodigious strength, was hired to work the ropes.

But, with the itinerant life providing few repercussions, he fell into bad habits. Drink, junk food, drugs, he indulged all of them to excess. For a time, these vices were enough, but then his old urges returned and his nomadic existence became a cover for him to resume killing. He stole clothes and makeup from performers, fashioning a disguise that would let him get close to his victims before he anesthetized them, bringing them back to his caravan, where they would awake to find themselves bound and at his mercy. He would finally get to have his fun, mentally and physically torturing them, their screams fueling him, before being lost in the night.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce their strength was at its lowest, he would carefully examine their fingers, searching for the prettiest, running them over his tongue to find the tastiest.

He wanted to surpass his father\u2019s reputation and end what he saw as the thinning of samurai culture with farmers often posing as samurai.  His father tried to turn Kazan\u2019s attention to more noble pursuits, but Kazan refused to heed his advice, and borrowing his father\u2019s katana, he embarked on a dark pilgrimage to prove his worth and rid Japan of imposters. Ignoring the code that had been taught to him, Kazan killed imposters in the hills and the valleys, on the beaches and in the woodland. The killings were brutal, cruel and morbid. He humiliated farmers and warriors alike, yanking off their topknots and stripping them of their armor. His rage, bloodlust and perverse sense of honor knew no bounds. Monks believed he was possessed by something dark and otherworldly and cursed him while a noble lord began to call him \u2018Oni-Yamaoka,\u2019 the rageful samurai, an insult both to Kazan and his family.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDetermined to redeem his family\u2019s name, Kazan now butchered anyone who dared call him Oni-Yamaoka. The insult confused him. He had defeated the best and he had purified the samurai class by ridding the land of imposters. How could anyone refer to him as an ogre? Had it been because he had marched onto a battlefield to cut down the fiercest warriors. Had it been because he had taken a kanabo and dashed hundreds of skulls with it?  Or had it been because of his need to secure a \u2018trophy\u2019 from his victims. It didn\u2019t matter. Being called an ogre was more than he could bear and an ominous voice in his head urged him to strike down the lord who had desecrated his name.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs Kazan made for the lord\u2019s town, he suddenly found himself face to face with a samurai standing on a dirt road, blocking his way. Kazan readied his kanabo. Without a word, the samurai attacked and quickly secured the upper hand. But he hesitated. With a devastating blow, Kazan crushed the samurai\u2019s head and cracked his helmet. As Kazan approached the fallen samurai, he saw his father\u2019s face and staggered back to his haunches. His father stared at Kazan with mingled shame and regret as he issued his last breath. Kazan closed his eyes and screamed in agony until he could scream no more. When he opened his eyes again\u2026 his father was gone. Not only had he killed his father, but he had allowed thieves to steal his body for armor.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBitter, lost and disillusioned, Kazan roamed the land aimlessly with his father\u2019s voice rattling in his head, taunting him, reminding him of his failures, sending him into fits of uncontrollable black rage. One day, walking in the woods, Kazan happened upon an Oni statue. He stopped and stood motionless for a long moment. The weathered and overgrown statue seemed to be ridiculing him, accusing him of being the imposter samurai he had so desperately sought to destroy. Kazan shook the laughing voice out of his head and half remembered the lord who had ridiculed him as \u2018Oni-Yamaoka.\u2019\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith renewed anger, Kazan journeyed to a town high up in the snowy mountains where the lord resided. A dozen samurai met Kazan at the gates of the town. A dozen samurai fell to his kanabo. His speed and strength were unmatched. His rage was incomprehensible. Covered in blood and gore, Kazan battled through the town and soon found the lord hiding in a villa. He dragged him out of a cabinet, sliced his tendons to immobilize him and watched him beg and squirm like a dog. Without hesitation, he thrust his fist into the lord\u2019s mouth and yanked out the wicked tongue that had desecrated his name.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESatisfied, Kazan exited the villa to find himself surrounded by dozens of farmers wielding rusted scythes, sharp pitchforks, and heavy clubs. He survived the first few assaults, but there were too many attackers coming from every direction.

She grew up torn between resenting her mother\u2019s absence from her life and admiring her presence on screen.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs a teenager, Jane secretly wished to emulate her mother\u2019s talent. She would direct and perform in plays, audition for TV commercials and help her father at his studio. During her senior year, she entered a national oratory contest and won first prize. Her performance attracted the attention of a radio-station that contacted her for an interview. During the live show, her natural charm and repartee impressed the staff, who offered her a part-time job at the station.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter graduating college in Communication, she quit her job at the station to work for a trendy variety show. But her frank delivery and ad-libs were not appreciated by the show\u2019s executives, who fired her after five months. Desperate for another opportunity, Jane pitched a show at the radio-station she used to work at, only to be turned down, her proposal being \u003Ci\u003Etoo risky\u003C/i\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFour months later, she received a phone call from a producer who had seen reruns of the show.

She disputed the crude inflammatory tone of \u003Ci\u003EQuick Talk\u003C/i\u003E and pushed for a relatable coverage of personal issues. Her honest delivery resonated with her audience and within weeks, the show\u2019s viewership was steadily growing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter two years, she launched a full-hour segment called \u003Ci\u003EThe Jane Romero Show\u003C/i\u003E, which was broadcast nationally and covered tabooed topics, including her personal struggle with abandonment. Her show broke records and her initials J.R. became synonymous with products ranging from beauty creams to fashion accessories.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut Jane needed more; she wanted others to follow in her footsteps. She published a memoir that covered her childhood with an absent mother. Her book was an instant best seller but was reviewed harshly. Critics called it \u003Ci\u003Ea serving of sad anecdotes seasoned with bland, generic self-help tips\u003C/i\u003E. Jane took this criticism to heart, since despite her success, a voice in the back of her mind was starting to doubt her achievements.\u003Cbr\u003EHer success also generated an increasingly demanding schedule and a growing pressure to entertain constantly. During a particularly tense week, she canned an episode and instead launched a two-hour-long special on divorce. Her stress peaked when she learned that her mother had agreed to star in her show.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJane put on a brave face and began the show. Most of it went without a hitch, but when her mother walked on set, smiling warmly at the audience, Jane\u2019s stomach lurched unpleasantly.

Then she started to relax and turned on the radio; classical music was playing. The drive was slow. Black ice covered the highway, which was packed with cars on their way back home. Night fell.

To process her shock and sorrow, she held onto the belief that the gods had a plan for her. Her new life was one of quiet servitude. She would tend to the gardens, prepare ceremonial meals, and polish ceremonial incense burners. At night, she would pray for a sign that would reveal her purpose.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen she came of age, she attended the high-ranking priests during the yearly worshiping of the sea-goat, the god of water and creation. Swinging a censer down the great hypostyle hall, she cast thick black fumes that reached the cold towering stone pillars before dissipating. Her worries lifted, and the resulting bliss made her feel closer to the gods than ever.

It was the sign Adiris had been waiting for.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe great hall was packed with followers who bowed down as Adiris entered.

His father died in a car accident when he was two, and his uncle took him in. His uncle was a strict, but fair man, who raised him to value education.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAt Kingston College, Adam discovered his father\u2019s published works, which triggered his passion for literature. His campus, however, was known for its focus on athletics. As a shy teenager with his nose stuck in books, he was the perfect prey for bullies. What he lacked in sports, he made up in grit. He learned to defend himself in the thick of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt\u2019s during his years in college that he started to imagine his life elsewhere. While his close friends orbited the music industry, he followed a surer path. His grades granted him admission to higher education, and there was a demand for teachers abroad.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter graduating university, he taught extra classes to afford applying fees overseas. He had a steady diet of long commutes, grading piles, nightly lesson plans, and early classes. After a year, he managed to apply for a position abroad. His first plane ride took him to Southern Japan for a new start.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHis life in Kagoshima was hectic. There was little time to do everything he took for granted back home. His Japanese was elementary at best, which slowed him down. Buying groceries took hours, long commutes had to be planned, and lesson plans relied on Japanese notions, which he had to learn.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut after a few months, he found his rhythm. He reflected on it one morning while riding the train to work. He no longer had to study the kanji characters filling the map. He knew his way. His language skills had improved, he felt connected to his students, and he\u2019d treat himself to luxurious restaurants on weekends. He even had his first vacation planned.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWithin seconds, Adam\u2019s world was brought down to a slow motion. Rails hissed, bags came pouring down, and the floor trembled before the hit: Adam crashed forward as the train flipped upside down. He landed on a window pane as an unhinged door came flying at a passenger. He rolled over so that the door would hit him instead of the girl. He shut his eyes as he braced for impact, but nothing happened.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe squinted one eye open and he saw nothing but darkness. A heavy Fog had taken over the train. Ice seemed to flow through his body, reaching his lips first, then the tip of his fingers before spreading to his legs. Lulled by the warm hum of the dark whisper, he closed his eyes, drifting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENo one truly knows what happened to Adam Francis. The school teachers imagined the worst when they watched the train derailment on the news and saw he was missing. Their fears seemed to be confirmed when Adam\u2019s bag was recovered from the crash site, but his body was never found. To this day, his uncle believes that Adam took off after the train crash, alive still, somewhere out there.","biography":"A resourceful teacher, able to adapt to new circumstances and develop strategies accordingly. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHis personal perks, \u003Cb\u003EDiversion\u003C/b\u003E, \u003Cb\u003EDeliverance\u003C/b\u003E and \u003Cb\u003EAutodidact\u003C/b\u003E, help him to distract The Killer, survive desperate situations, and become more skilled as the trial continues.","requiredDlcIdString":"Haiti","idName":"Adam","defaultItem":"None","isAvailableInNonViolentBuild":false,"isAvailableInAtlantaBuild":true,"platformExclusiveFlag":0,"killerAbilities":[],"gender":"EGender::VE_Male","killerHeight":"EKillerHeight::Average","iconPath":"/characters/Haiti/AF_charSelect_portrait.png","backgroundPath":"UI/Icons/StoreBackgrounds/storeBackground_AF.png","slideShowDescriptions":{"overview":"Adam Francis\u00A0is a resourceful teacher, able to adapt to new circumstances and develop strategies accordingly.","playStyle":"Adam can distract the Killer, survive desperate situations, and increase his skill as the trial continues."}},"4":{"characterIndex":4,"role":"EPlayerRole::VE_Camper","difficulty":"ECharacterDifficulty::VE_Intermediate","displayName":"Nea Karlsson","backStory":"Nea grew up in the small town of Hjo in Sweden.
